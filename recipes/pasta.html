    <h2>Description</h2>

        “The best recipe ever,” raves The happy traveller. “My husband was licking the empty bowl. I added cherry tomatoes and will go lighter on the red onion next time.”
    </p>

        “Delicious,” according to one Allrecipes community member. “Looking for a recipe for a summer family reunion, with no mayo. This was perfect! Even looks nice.”

        “Yummy and easy,” says another community member. “I don't worry about the color of the peppers — I use whatever I have on hand. Hubby isn't a fan of raw onions, so I add chopped chives instead which are much milder, but still give a hint of onion taste.”

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pasta: This colorful Italian pasta salad recipe starts with tri-color rotini pasta.</li>
